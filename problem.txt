The email is in a valid format.
The password is at least 8 characters long.
The password and confirm password fields match.

Implementation Tips
HTML: Structure your application with appropriate elements (e.g., forms, buttons, divs).
CSS: Style your application to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.
JavaScript: Implement the logic for interactivity, data handling, and API calls.
These problems can be tackled individually or as part of a larger project, and they cover a range of skills that are essential for web development.
